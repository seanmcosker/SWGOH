SWGOH Sentiment Analysis: Twitter Webscraping 

This mini-project of mine involves using Twitter's API to scrape tweets about an EA mobile game, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH, for short). The game involves battling against other players using a team of Star Wars characters the player must obtain through farming or in-app purchases. The game is free to play with a variety of microtransactions offered.

As a player myself, there was often a good amount of animosity towards Capital Games and Electronic Arts about the state of the game, the quality of new additions to the app, and pricing for in-game transactions. Given this, I was curious if I could quantify this sentiment using tweets mentioning the game. I hope to expand this sentiment analysis to the EA forums at a later date, and (provided I can find the data), I'd like to perform market analysis on EA's revenue from the game and attempt to tie it back to general player sentiment.
